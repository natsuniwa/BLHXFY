0,,The crew arrive at the town entrance and are awestruck by the massive horde of monsters before them.,一行人到了城镇门口，被他们面前的巨大怪物群惊到了。
1,Katalina/卡塔莉娜,Looks like quite a few monsters got loose. This could be trouble.,似乎不少魔物都被放出来了。这的确是个麻烦。
2,Vyrn/碧,We gotta take 'em out before someone gets hurt!,我们得在有人受伤之前解决他们。
3,Richard,"Hah! Such uncouth beasts could never match me in skill. I shall defeat them for you, Therese, my sweet. En garde!",哈哈，这些粗鲁的魔物根本不可能是我的对手。我要为你击败他们，特蕾莎，我的宝贝。预备！
4,Lyria/露莉亚,"Hmm, you don't often see these kinds of monsters around Port Breeze...",嗯，你在微风港不常见这类的魔物...
5,Richard,"They're most likely from another island, brought here because they have some kind of connection to the festival.",很可能他们是从其它岛上来被带到这里来的，因为与节日有某种关系。

7,Richard,"Well, Port Breeze's Festival of Falling Flame originally comes from an old legend about a powerful fire monster.",微风港的阵焰祭最开始就起源于一头强大的火焰魔物的古老传说。
8,Richard,Makes sense that people would bring fire monsters from far away to add to the spectacle.,这样的话，人们把火怪从远方带到这里，增添这一壮观景象的行为就说得通了。
9,Vyrn/碧,So what exactly is this whole legend thing with the fire monster?,那么，与这个火焰魔物的传说具体是什么呢？

11,Richard,"If his word is to be believed, then the festival is not just connected to any old monster, but a primal beast, no less.",如果他的话是真的，那么这个节日不是与任何古老的魔物有关，而是至少与一位星晶兽有关。
12,Richard,The legend tells of a mighty primal beast of fire that visits the island but once a year... The immortal Phoenix.,这个传说述说了一位神奇的星晶兽，它每年都会来一次这座岛...不朽的菲尼克斯
13,Lyria/露莉亚,Phoenix?,菲尼克斯？
