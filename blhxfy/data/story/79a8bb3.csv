1,Host with the Most,"All righty, gentlefolk! It's time for the Q & A segment you've been waiting for—Ask a Skyracer!",女士们先生们，终于到了振奋人心的赛艇手问答环节！

15,Maddie,You gotta have that burning resolve not to lose to your rival. That's what wins out in the end. That's it.,你必须有不输于人的强烈决心，这样才能取得最终的胜利，就是这样。
16,Host with the Most,"Exactly the kind of straight answer I'd expect from you, Maddie! What's your take on it, Meteon?",果然是这种直接又确切的回答，缪恩是怎么看的呢？
17,Meteon,"This might sound strange, but lately I'm starting to think that experiencing defeat is essential if you ever want to achieve a true victory.",这样说可能会有点怪，其实我最近开始思考，在超越别人取得胜利的道路上，失败其实是必然的。
18,Meteon,Accepting your defeats and learning from them... Not losing to your<span class='scene-font-italic'>self...</span> I think that might be where the real victory lies.,接受自己的失败并从中吸取教训，永不言弃，我想这就是胜利的诀窍。

29,Host with the Most,"So... What would your answer be, Meteon?",所以，缪恩选手的回答呢。
30,Meteon,"If you're asking for advice, I'd recommend studying under someone more experienced. Learn all you can, and start out by imitating the way they race.",如果想听我的建议的话，我还是觉得向更有经验的人学习会比较好。尽可能多的向前辈学习，从模仿他们开始。

50,Lyria/露莉亚,(Nicholas and the Rashomon crew really are impressive. Even Maddie has to admit it!),士郎先生和罗生门博士的比赛确实让人印象深刻，就连马蒂先生也这么觉得。
51,Host with the Most,They do say that a mechanic is even more important to a skyracer than their speedship itself.,他们确实说过，一个好的机械师对于赛艇手来说，比一艘好的赛艇更加重要。
52,Meteon,The most advanced speedship in the skies is no better than a pushcart without a talented mechanic to take care of it.,如果没有一名优秀的机械师进行维护的话，最先进的赛艇连人力车都不如。

57,Host with the Most,"Behind every great racer is a great mechanic, as they say!",正如人们所说，优秀的赛艇选手背后，总有一名优秀的机械师。
58,Meteon,Fangio taught me that a good skyracer needs a mechanic's knowledge and techniques too.,是范吉奥让我明白，赛艇手同样需要机械相关知识和技术。
